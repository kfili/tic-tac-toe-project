##Game URL:
https://kfili.github.io/tic-tac-toe-project/

##Technologies used to make this project:
javascript, jQuery, JSON, Ajax, Curl, Github (version control), HTML, SCSS

##Planning:
For planning I used wireframes:
https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1FRIiKBJy5gUeLUbL_l5s-GBwFNYvbAPCeLZ7G4VnZ0g/edit?usp=sharing

I also used user stories.
As a user I want to:
  || sign up for a new account.
  || sign in to an existing account.
  || play a game.
  || read the number of games I have played.
  || sign out.

##Development Process:
- Read requirements and API documentation.
- Start with a template of authentication functions.
- Build starter webpage with HTML and SCSS.
- Get sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out working.
- Deploy to gh-pages.
- Design game logic with pseudo code.
- Build game logic.
- Debug game logic.
- Deploy to gh-pages.
- Build game API functions.
- Finishing touches on UI and aesthetics.
- Deploy to gh-pages.

##Problem-solving strategy
- Fix linter errors.
- Use grunt serve to host the website locally for testing.
- Read error messages.
- Use console log and debuggers to figure out what functions are doing.
- Consult team mate.
- Look up the up any error messages or problems.
- Report an issue.

##Unsolved problems:
- The text that shows results of HTTP requests
- Game board not centered on page.
- No online multiplayer support.
- No HTTPS, users must be warned not to use real emails and passwords.
- Game not playable unless signed in, creating a barrier to new users.
- Number of games played should be displayed from button on drop down menu.
